    1. Hippocratic Before Socratic
    <br>
    “First do no harm” is a good starting point for everyone, but it’s an especially good starting point for designers.
    For a group of people who pride themselves on “problem solving” and improving people’s lives, we sure have done our fair share of the converse.
    We have to remember that industrial design equals mass production, and that every move, every decision, every curve we specify is multiplied—sometimes by the thousands and often by the millions. And that every one of those everys has a price.
    We think that we’re in the artifact business, but we’re not; we’re in the consequence business.

        <p>Contradictory consciousness-management has superseded social anxiety about Bad Faith. This has long been the thesis of Slavoj Žižek. Let’s work on this thesis and take seriously the cynical statement “They know what they do, but they do it anyway” and apply this to social media. There is no longer a need to investigate the potential of “new media” and deconstruct their intentions. The internet has reached its hegemonic stage. In previous decades it was premature to associate intensive 24/7 usage by millions with deep structures such as the (sub)conscious. Now that we live fully in social media times, it has become pertinent to do precisely that: link techne with psyche.
        </p>
        <p>The revelations of Edward Snowden arrived long after our daily surf-and-swap routines had become firmly entrenched. We know we’re watched by surveillance systems but who can honesty claim to constantly be aware of them? Artistic masks are promoted as protective face shields—yet who wears them? The internet may be broken, as the phrase goes (and IT engineers have reached a consensus about this troubling analysis), but this cannot be said of social media.2 Like Snowden’s revelations, Sherry Turkle’s evidence about smartphones inhibiting one’s empathy and ability to enjoy the virtues of solitude have arrived late in the social media game.3 How hard has it become to confront offline boredom? It’s a straight-up torture.
        </p>
        <p>
        The slogan “You are what you share” (Charles Leadbeater) expresses the transformation of the autonomous unit of the self into an outgoing entity that is constantly reproducing its social capital through the transmission of value (data) to others. Let’s face it: we refuse to perceive ourselves as “slaves of the machine.” What does it mean when we all agree that there is an addictive element to today’s social media use, yet none of us is apparently addicted? Are we really returning only sporadically?4 What exactly is being captured here? If anything, we’re encapsulated by the social sphere as such, not by the software, nor by the protocols, network architectures, or the assuredly infantile interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this spell of desire for the social, led by the views and opinions of our immediate social circle, our daily routines are as follows: view recent stories first, fine-tune filter preferences, jump to first unread, update your life with events, clear and refresh all, not now, save links to read for later, see full conversation, mute your ex, set up a secret board, run a poll, comment through the social plug-in, add video to your profile, choose between love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, engage with those who mention you while tracking the changes in relationship status of others, follow a key opinion leader, receive notifications, create a photo spread that links to your avatar, repost a photo, get lost in the double-barrel river of your timeline, prevent friends from seeing updates, check out something based on a recommendation, customize cover images, create “must-click” headlines, chat with a friend while noticing that “1,326,595 people like this topic.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Social networking is much more than just a dominant discourse. We need to go beyond text and images and include its software, interfaces, and networks that depend on a technical infrastructure consisting of offices and their consultants and cleaners, cables and data centers, working in close concert with the movements and habits of the connected billions. Academic internet studies circles have shifted their attention from utopian promises, impulses, and critiques to “mapping” the network’s impact. From digital humanities to data science we see a shift in network-oriented inquiry from Whether and Why, What and Who, to (merely) How. From a sociality of causes to a sociality of net effects. A new generation of humanistic researchers is lured into the “big data” trap, and kept busy capturing user behavior whilst producing seductive eye candy for an image-hungry audience (and vice versa).
      </p>
      <p>
        Without noticing, we have arrived at a new, yet unnamed, stage: the hegemonic era of social media platforms as ideology. Products and services are of course usually subject to ideology. We have learned to “read” ideology into them. But at what point can we convincingly say they have become ideology themselves? It is one thing to state that Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook) is an ideologue, working in the service of US intelligence agencies, or to document community or political groups using his social media platform in ways unplanned or counter to expectations inherent to its design. It is quite another to work on a comprehensive social media theory. It is a crucial time for critical theory to reclaim lost territory and bring on exactly this: a shift from the quantitative to the qualitative, uncomputable impacts of this ubiquitous formatting of the social. It is liberating for research to sever itself from the instrumental approach of (viral) marketing and public relations. Stop pushing, start analyzing. Network technologies are rapidly becoming the “new normal,” withdrawing their operations and governance from view. We need to politicize the New Electricity, the privately owned utilities of our century, before they disappear into the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2008 chapter of internet criticism is coming to a close. For the next round of The Critique of the Political Economy, the internet and digital technologies will have to be fully integrated. The easy opposition of California utopians vs. Euro pessimists has been superseded by much larger planetary issues such as the future of work. We need to take internet critique beyond the normative regulation of behavior and politicize the anxiety of the youth and their particular addictions and distractions. We have long come to terms with the actual and virtual nature of the social, as its potential for play and manipulation seems increasingly in abeyance. Social media demand from us that we perform in a never-ending show. We keep coming back, always remaining logged in, until the #DigitalDetox sets in and we’re called to different realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The social, political, and economic promise of the internet as a decentralized network of networks lies in tatters. Social media alternatives, five years after their initial appearance, haven’t made much progress at all.5 Despite all well-intended critical predictions, the herds have not moved on to greener pastures. The overall picture is one of stagnation in a field defined by the corporate domination of a handful of players. We all remain stuck in the social media mud, and it’s time to ask why. Comparable to the late-1970s stagnation in mainstream media critique, a political economy approach will not be sufficient if we want to come up with workable strategies. One possible way out could be a post-Freudian answer to the question: What’s on a User’s Mind?6 We need to answer the question as to what social media actually offer. Which desires do they appeal to? Why is updating such a seductive yet boring habit? Can we develop a set of critical concepts that would describe our compulsive attraction to social media, without reducing that attraction to addiction rhetoric?
      </p>
      <p>
        A starting point for reading social media as ideology would be Wendy Chun’s 2004 essay on the idea of “software” as ideology.7 Chun’s work, along with the work of Jodi Dean and others, speaks strongly to the media theorist coming to terms with the peak of neoliberal transition and the triumph of proprietary software. The prominence of ideology as a central term in debates has faded away since the mid-1980s. The backdrop of ideology theory in the 1970s was the spectacular peaking of the power of the state apparatus (also called the welfare state) that was commissioned to administrate the postwar class compromise. Whilst Daniel Bell’s End of Ideology, as announced in 1960, had arrived with the victory of neoliberalism at the end of the Cold War, there was an intuitive feeling that ideology—with a small i—had not yet left the stage, and the World Without Ideas was not yet within reach, despite concerted efforts to diminish the role of public intellectuals and critical discourses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “Californian ideology” as defined in 1995 by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron helped us trace the motives underlying the internet back to their Cold War roots (and the ambivalent hippie culture). Fred Turner’s 2006 classic From Counterculture to Cyberculture did much the same. But the historical perspective is not much use if it cannot explain social media’s contemporary and persistent success since the 1990s. Now, as in the 1970s, the role of ideology in navigating the limits of existing systems is all too real. To study ideology is to take a close look at this everyday life, here and now. What remains particularly unexplained is the apparent paradox between the hyper-individualized subject and the herd mentality of the social. What’s wrong with the social? What’s right with it? Positivity is as pervasive in California as it is in the Italian cyberspace scene, which, in a Gramscian move, has embraced the “social network” as a sign within popular culture that the multitude can beat the mainstream in its act of mediation. Italian critics, activists, and artists are not unlike many others in being hyperaware of all the controversies that surround the products and services made in Silicon Valley, while remaining mostly positive about the magic potion called social networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        One function of ideology as defined by Louis Althusser is recognition, the (in)famous interpellation of the subject that is being called upon.7 We can apply this and speak of the process of becoming-user. This is the unnoticed part of the social media saga. Before we enter the social media sphere, everyone first fills out a profile and choses a username and password in order to create an account. Minutes later, you’re part of the game and you start sharing, creating, playing, as if it has always been like that. The profile is the a priori part and the profiling and targeted advertising cannot operate without it. The platforms present themselves as self-evident. They just are—facilitating our feature-rich lives. Everyone that counts is there. It is through the gate of the profile that we become its subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Althusser, we live inside ideology in this way—the formula applies in particular to social media in which subjects are addressed as users who do not exist without a profile. It is justified to use this slightly authoritarian, hermetic concept of ideology because of the highly centralized top-down structure of social media architecture in this age of platform capitalism, which leaves zero space for users to reprogram their communication spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all the postmodernism and cynical neoliberalism that has deemed it redundant, it is no surprise that ideology (again) rules. (It is more remarkable how total the concept’s fall from use has been.) The main issue is that we are less and less aware of how it rules. When it comes to social media we have an “enlightened false consciousness” in which we know very well what we are doing when we are fully sucked in, but we do it anyway. This even accounts at a meta-level for the popularity of Žižek’s insights—and could be one of the best explanations for his success. We’re all aware of the algorithmic manipulations of Facebook’s news feed, the filter-bubble effect in apps, and the persuasive presence of personalized advertisement. We pull in updates, 24/7, in a real-time global economy of interdependencies, having been taught to read news feeds as interpersonal indicators of the planetary condition. So in what way does Louis Althusser need updating?
      </p>
      <p>
        Four decades after the Althusser era, we do not associate ideology with the state in the same way he and his followers did. To qualify Facebook and Google as falling within the Althusserian definition of “ideological state apparatus” sounds odd, if not exotic. In this era of late neoliberalism and right-wing populism, ideology is associated with the market, not with the state, which has withdrawn into the role of merely securing the market. But lest we forget, it was ideology theory itself that contributed to the “crisis of marxism.” It led the way in opening up marxism to issues thrust to the fore by the student movement, the rise of feminism, and other “new social movements,” and also highlighted the stagnation and bankruptcy of the Soviet Union. The growing interest in media and “cultural studies” did the rest.

        <b><h3>THE CALIFORNIAN IDEOLOGY</h3></b>
        Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron
        <i><h5>"Not to lie about the future is impossible and one can lie about it at will"</i>
        <br>
        - Naum Gabo</h5>
        <h4>As the Dam Bursts</h4>
        <p>
        At the end of the twentieth century, the long predicted convergence of the media, computing and
        telecommunications into hypermedia is finally happening.Once again, capitalism's relentless drive to diversify and intensify the creative powers of human labour is on the verge of qualitatively transforming
        the way in which we work, play and live together. By integrating different technologies around common
        protocols, something is being created which is more than the sum of its parts. When the ability to
        produce and receive unlimited amounts of information in any form is combined with the reach of the
        global telephone networks, existing forms of work and leisure can be fundamentally transformed. New
        industries will be born and current stock market favourites will swept away. At such moments of
        profound social change, anyone who can offer a simple explanation of what is happening will be listened
        to with great interest. At this crucial juncture, a loose alliance of writers, hackers, capitalists and artists
        from the West Coast of the USA have succeeded in defining a heterogeneous orthodoxy for the coming
        information age: the Californian Ideology.</p>
        <p>
          This new faith has emerged from a bizarre fusion of the cultural bohemianism of San Francisco with the
          hi-tech industries of Silicon Valley. Promoted in magazines, books, TV programmes, websites,
          newsgroups and Net conferences, the Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling
          spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies. This amalgamation of opposites has been
          achieved through a profound faith in the emancipatory potential of the new information technologies. In
          the digital utopia, everybody will be both hip and rich. Not surprisingly, this optimistic vision of the future has been enthusiastically embraced by computer nerds, slacker students, innovative capitalists, social
          activists, trendy academics, futurist bureaucrats and opportunistic politicians across the USA. As usual,Europeans have not been slow in copying the latest fad from America. While a recent EU Commission
          report recommends following the Californian 'free market' model for building the 'information superhighway', cutting-edge artists and academics eagerly imitate the 'post-human' philosophers of the
          West Coast's Extropian cult.With no obvious rivals, the triumph of the Californian Ideology appears to
          be complete.</p>
        <p>The widespread appeal of these West Coast ideologues isn't simply the result of their infectious
          optimism. Above all, they are passionate advocates of what appears to be an impeccably libertarian
          form of politics - they want information technologies to be used to create a new 'Jeffersonian
          democracy' where all individuals will be able to express themselves freely within cyberspace.However,
          by championing this seemingly admirable ideal, these techno-boosters are at the same time reproducing
          some of the most atavistic features of American society, especially those derived from the bitter legacy
          of slavery. Their utopian vision of California depends upon a wilful blindness towards the other - much
          less positive - features of life on the West Coast: racism, poverty and environmental degradation.3
          Ironically, in the not too distant past, the intellectuals and artists of the Bay Area were passionately
          concerned about these issues.</p>

        <h4>Ronald Reagan v. the Hippies</h4>
        <p>
        On 15th May 1969, Governor Ronald Reagan ordered armed police to carry out a dawn raid against
        hippie protesters who had occupied People's Park near the Berkeley campus of the University of
        California. During the subsequent battle, one man was shot dead and 128 other people needed hospital
        treatment. On that day, the 'straight' world and the counter-culture appeared to be implacably
        opposed. On one side of the barricades, Governor Reagan and his followers advocated unfettered
        private enterprise and supported the invasion of Vietnam. On the other side, the hippies championed a
        social revolution at home and opposed imperial expansion abroad. In the year of the raid on People's
        Park, it seemed that the historical choice between these two opposing visions of America's future could
        only be settled through violent conflict. As Jerry Rubin, one of the Yippie leaders, said at the time: 'Our
        search for adventure and heroism takes us outside America, to a life of self-creation and rebellion. In
        response, America is ready to destroy us...'</p>

        <p>During in the 1960s, radicals from the Bay Area pioneered the political outlook and cultural style of
          New Left movements across the world. Breaking with the narrow politics of the post-war era, they
          launched campaigns against militarism, racism, sexual discrimination, homophobia, mindless
          consumerism and pollution. In place of the traditional left's rigid hierarchies, they created collective and
          democratic structures which supposedly prefigured the libertarian society of the future. Above all, the
          Californian New Left combined political struggle with cultural rebellion. Unlike their parents, the hippies
          refused to conform to the rigid social conventions imposed on 'organisation man' by the military, the
          universities, the corporations and even left-wing political parties. Instead they openly declared their
          rejection of the ‘straight’ world through their casual dress, sexual promiscuity, loud music and
          recreational drugs.</p>

          <p>The radical hippies were liberals in the social sense of the word. They championed universalist, rational
            and progressive ideals, such as democracy, tolerance, self-fulfillment and social justice. Emboldened by
            over twenty years of economic growth, they believed that history was on their side. In sci-fi novels, they
            dreamt of 'ecotopia': a future California where cars had disappeared, industrial production was
            ecologically viable, sexual relationships were egalitarian and daily life was lived in community groups.2
            For some hippies, this vision could only be realised by rejecting scientific progress as a false God and
            returning to nature. Others, in contrast, believed that technological progress would inevitably turn their
            libertarian principles into social fact. Crucially, influenced by the theories of Marshall McLuhan, these
            technophiliacs thought that the convergence of media, computing and telecommunications would
            inevitably create the electronic agora - a virtual place where everyone would be able to express their
            opinions without fear of censorship. Despite being a middle-aged English professor, McLuhan
            preached the radical message that the power of big business and big government would be imminently
            overthrown by the intrinsically empowering effects of new technology on individuals.</p>

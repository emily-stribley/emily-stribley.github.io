	The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.
	<br>
	Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design.
	<br>
	But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

	A product is bought to be used.
	<br>
	It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic.
	<br>
	Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.
